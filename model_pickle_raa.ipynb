    "This notebook illustrates how to import a trained model that predicts the expected runs to be scored by a batter in a given situation. The situation here is defined by a combination of (Innings Phase, Team Wickets Lost, Ball No For Batter).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained using XGBoost over 589,000 balls from 2588 T20 games since 2015, including high-level T20Is, IPL, PSL, CPL, BBL games. The model accounts for the \"settling in\" phase of batters.  \n",

    "\n",
    "* 1: Powerplay (1-6)\n",
